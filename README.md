# Snag

This is a simple sample application that I created for learning about Android development. I started with the [notepad tutorial](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/index.html), ditched the subject line, and added tagging and filtering.

This is pretty much just for my own education. I wouldn't recommend you actually use it.
